Donating blood is a vital way to help save lives. Additionally, there are a number of reasons

technological advances, blood cannot be made, so donations are the only way we can give blood
to those who need it. Donating blood is one of the most common ways people choose to give
back to their communities, and the demand for blood in hospitals is always high. Many people
are not aware of just how important blood donations can be. Approximately one of every seven
people admitted to the hospital need blood and also researchers have proven that a single
donation can save up to three lives.
